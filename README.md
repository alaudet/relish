Relish Photo Resizer
====================

Relish is a simple python photo resolution resizer.


Why Relish?  I don't know, because it tastes good on a hamburger and all names are used up anyways.  Why Windows? Why Apple?


Mostly just for fun, because I needed a simple command line tool to do quick resizes.
